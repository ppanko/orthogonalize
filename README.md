# orthogonalize

The aim of the `orthogonalize` package is to streamline the process of residualizing covariates by letting C++ do some of the heavy lifting. 

Install `orthogonalize` in your R session by running the following code:

```R
devtools::install_github("ppanko/orthogonalize")
```

TODO: 

* orthoMulti - accept multivariate formulas (either as a list or
  as multiple lhs)
* Easier formula parsing (with S3)
* Add RcppParallel option!
